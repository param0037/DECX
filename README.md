# DECX
A fast linear algebra, computer vision and mathematic library, based on CUDA and CPU multi-thread

# MODULES
1. Basic calculations such as addition, subtraction, etc.
2. Basic operations such as matrix transpose, type casting, etc.
3. General matrix multiplication(GEMM) and convolution, most frequently used functions in varieties of fields.
4. Signal processing APIs. Such as fast Fourier transform(FFT), inverse fast Fourier transform(IFFT) and many kinds of filters for 1D array and 2D matrix. 
5. APIs for computer vision. (developing)
6. APIs for vector4 (can represent 3D vector and point). Such as linear transformï¼Œdivergence and rotation, etc.

# To developers and viewers
You can download and modify my source to compile your own project if you want. And you can also tell me what functionality you want me to integrate. If you have 
better ideas, please contact me via enloquecer0037@gmail.com. I hope my library can help you with your research or coursework.
